# Specialized Armor
While still titled Specialized Armor, this mod will offer much more than that (and will be retitled whenever a superior name is discovered.)

Vanilla armors and tools are provided in a linear fashion. Each one offeres better performance, but there is nothing special about each upgrade, and some materials are thoroughly worthless (like gold, for instance.) This mod attempts to change that. By making new, advanced machines, the player can customize tools and armors with unique power-ups and intensities. SPAR also adds new materials to build armors and tools, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

At the time, the mod really doesn't have much. However, I have figured out the fundamental principles of Minecraft mod creation and have developed a base that can be used to add the additional items needed.

The mod's progress can be viewed in a more organized format on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/QqzaN3IS/random-shrubs-specialized-armor).
