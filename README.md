# Specialized Armor
While still titled Specialized Armor, this mod will offer much more than that (and will be retitled whenever a superior name is discovered.)

Vanilla armors and tools are provided in a linear fashion. Each one offeres better performance, but there is nothing special about each upgrade, and some materials are thoroughly worthless (like gold, for instance.) This mod attempts to change that. By making new, advanced machines, the player can customize tools and armors with unique power-ups and intensities. SPAR also adds new materials to build armors and tools, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

At the time, the mod really doesn't have much. However, I have figured out the fundamental principles of Minecraft mod creation and have developed a base that can be used to add the additional items needed.

The mod's progress can be viewed in a more organized format on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/QqzaN3IS/random-shrubs-specialized-armor).

3/25/19: Yes, this is still a thing. I was just statisically significantly busy for the past two weeks and will be returning to a business as usual level here.

4/29/19: GAHH It's been over a month but I still intend on getting back to this. It is AP exam time and I'm working on some other personal projects. :)

5/17/19: Last AP exam was yesterday. I felt mostly well about all of them and believe that I at least passed all five. I will be resuming work on this project now.
